# fleet-manager outbox (manager → owner lane)

<!-- Convention: this is the manager→OWNER channel — the mirror of the lane→manager
     outboxes the seats write. Append-only: dated sections, newest last; never rewrite
     or delete prior entries. The manager (this repo's coordinator seat) is the sole
     writer. The owner reads this file for the roll-up reports (morning tally, incident
     records); paste-ready click lists live here so the owner never has to derive a
     step. Machine state stays in control/status.md (overwrite-own); this file is the
     durable report ledger. Created 2026-07-13 (ORDER 039/040 morning tally). -->

## 2026-07-13 · MORNING TALLY — NIGHT RUN 2026-07-12T22:30Z → 06:00Z

Compiled 2026-07-13T05:00Z by the morning-tally worker (fable-5), dispatched by the
coordinator (session_01UutkJqyMcHC1VyFW8fe1a9). Sweep basis: read-only github MCP pass
over every seat, activity window 02:30Z→04:58Z, on top of the fm-side night record
(#142–#157). Merge/PR states below are API-verified at ~04:5xZ unless labelled
lane-reported.

### Fleet manager (this seat)

- SHIPPED: #142–#155 + #157 merged (+ automated roster #145/#156). ORDERs landed:
  019/021/022 flips, 023–041 (+ 042/043 in this PR). Playbook: R24 authenticity gate +
  R27 backup ladder + the R27 DETECTION amendment (#155). v3.6 prompt generation
  canonical in the registry — 9 seats incl. Curious Research; skim doc
  docs/prompts/v3/CHANGES-v3.4-to-v3.5.md; **owner re-paste owed** (deployed seats
  still run v3.4 pastes).
- Enablers installed fleet-wide: superbot-idle @ 457407c (INERT until B#50),
  superbot-games @ dd867c8 (self-proven), superbot-next @ e9f1cd5 (self-proven),
  gba-homebrew @ 0e08695 (INERT until B#51 — live-confirmed tonight: run 29222310196
  on gba #85 refused to arm, zero required contexts). fm merge-on-green: cron backstop
  PROVEN 03:53:24Z run #49.
- OPEN PRs: 0 before this tally PR. Roster generation current: **gen #23**
  (generated-at 04:10Z, Actions regen; next cron slot ~06:40Z).
- STALLED: one remediation worker went silent overnight — findings superseded by the
  lane's self-recovery; no impact.

### Per-seat: SHIPPED / OPEN-PRs / QUEUED / STALLED

**superbot-next (ORDER 030; local ORDER 017 night run)** — the night's hottest lane.
- SHIPPED: **completeness table landed** (#326, per-subsystem, ORDER 017 item 1);
  curation report #327 (1,088 items: 918 KEEP / 110 REWORK / 60 DROP); **fishing port
  COMPLETE** (#313→#330→#342→#350 — 20/20 commands live, `_unmapped` retired, one real
  codex P1 coral double-spend fixed stricter-than-oracle); setup wizard interior #340;
  **game-sections D-0082 slices 1–3 merged** (#334/#337/#341 — registry+seam, settings
  surface, hub renders enabled set: the SBW casino spec CONSUMED); 11 merges in the
  02:30→04:07Z window alone (#334–#353).
- OPEN-PRs: **16** at 04:5xZ (write-parity stack #312→#317→#335→#344; curation reworks
  #332/#333/#345/#347/#349/#351/#354/#355/#356; btd6 #339/#352; mining energy #320 —
  carries the dig-gating A/B/C ask) — open-PRs-stay-open posture per the night rule.
- QUEUED: superbot #2058/#2061 mineverse FLAG 1/2 held as DRAFTS (merge=deploy guard,
  Q-0193); CodeQL raised 6 alerts (1 high) on #2061 — owner review before deploy.
- STALLED: none. Two 01:37Z ticks dropped in the scheduler window; chain re-armed,
  backup wake 05:05Z armed, seat active (heartbeat 02:47Z + merges to 04:07Z).

**SuperBot World seat — games / idle / mineverse (ORDERs 031 + 037; local ORDER 004)**
- SHIPPED: **ORDER 037 DONE** — the malformed mining `updated:` stamp is FIXED (games
  #76, merged 02:42:35Z); exploration finalized (games #77). **Casino/minigame section
  spec published** (mineverse #58 → docs/design/minigame-section-spec-2026-07-13.md,
  outbox pointer #59) **and already consumed by superbot-next** (D-0082 slices above).
  ORDER 004 tally posted (mineverse heartbeat 04:12Z): games #68–#77 (suite 310→516),
  idle #75–#82 merged 00:03–01:50Z (suite →1,260, 15 packs; playable REPL, wave-4
  packs, adapter inc1+inc2), mineverse #55–#63 (suite 437→522; FLAG-1 consume seam,
  FLAG-2 write hardening, conformance runner). Per-game state table: all four world
  games ✅ reviewed/standalone/integrated; idle ✅ with adapter; mineverse read ✅ /
  write-ready pending the secret pair.
- OPEN-PRs: none lane-side (superbot-next #320 write-parity stack tracked above).
- QUEUED: idle SIM-001 economy-FEEL SIM-REQUEST + **2 owner questions needing fleet
  Q-numbers** (generator-purchase economy; content-depth/endgame) in idle outbox —
  SIM half routed as ORDER 043 this PR; Q-number mints = manager follow-up. 4 games
  SIM-REQUESTs + D2 ratification in games outbox. Six-secret pair
  (MINING_WRITE_ENDPOINT/SECRET) → conformance is then one command.
- STALLED: none (the permission-walled fishing session was superseded by the rebuild
  lane — recommend owner archive it).
- NOTE on B#50: parked idle #75/#76 have since **merged** (01:26/01:23Z, ORDER 029
  standing-permission path) — the click is no longer blocking those PRs but still
  arms the idle enabler for future self-landing.

**Ideas Lab — idea-engine / sim-lab (ORDER 032 standing + ORDER 043 new)**
- SHIPPED (cycle count overnight): **10 proposals + 10 verdicts** — PROPOSALs 016–025
  (idea-engine, latest #291 merged 04:53Z) → VERDICTs 017–026 (sim-lab, latest #71
  merged 04:50Z). Honest mix per the standing order: approvals (V017 assignment lane),
  rejects (V023 renumber-treadmill, V025 ticket envelope), nulls (V024 KEEP-margins
  noise, V026 Braess added-edge), plus V022 casino fairness envelope feeding the
  casino/games lane.
- Pile-up resolution: the Ideas Lab failsafe cron WEDGED at the 01:38Z slot (scheduler
  degradation window) — slipped ONE slot and recovered; the pipeline itself never
  stopped (merges continuous 02:39→04:53Z). The 8-seat tick queue flushed 02:30–02:50Z.
- OPEN-PRs: 0 both repos. QUEUED: ORDER 043 intake (this PR). STALLED: none.

**Venture Lab — venture-lab / trading-strategy (ORDER 033 standing)**
- PRODUCTS (heartbeat 01:49Z): SWTK $29 **verified LIVE on Gumroad**; 3 publish-READY
  with clicks queued (membership-kit $49, template-packs $19 PWYW, Agent Fleet Field
  Manual $39); PRs #104–#112 merged.
- BOOKS: 6 new concept packets; **9 board-book manuscripts** (EN/NL/DE × 3 titles);
  Ultramarine serial 3 episodes; Slow Word novella 18,986w + large-print spec; 3 more
  drafts in flight (Weigh House, Night Kiln, Pepper Ledger).
- TRADING (API-verified): trading #81–#95 merged through the night — Round-3 program
  slices 1–15 + the R3 synthesis (#89: 1,752 configs, 0 PROMOTED / 41 KEEP-dev / 125
  KILL of 166 lanes) — **program cumulative 4,148 registered configs, 0 PROMOTED,
  holdout untouched**, honest nulls throughout; last merge 04:29Z (#95 hourly-matrix
  completion). Weekly grading cron next 07-17.
- New outbox markers (night batch 1, ~01:49Z): 2× WEBSITE-IDEA (→ ORDER 042), 1×
  SIM-REQUEST serial pricing (→ ORDER 043), 1× INFO board-book fulfillment is off-KDP
  (IngramSpark-class needed — owner decision on fulfillment channel pending).
- OPEN-PRs: 0 trading / heartbeat-fresh venture. STALLED: none.

**substrate-kit (ORDER 034; local ORDER 016 night run)**
- SHIPPED: #308 K0 orientation-headroom gauge; #310 current-state condensation
  (6,913→2,862 words); #311/#312 idea-drift guard + reconciliation; #314 ORDER 016
  landed verbatim; **#315 seed skills chase-references + prep-owner-steps into the
  registry** (12 skills); #316 rationalization-checkpoint doctrine + `rationalize`
  skill (13 skills) — the Q-0273 self-initiative program generalized, per ORDER 034.
- OPEN-PRs: 1 — #317 rider-graduation (Q-0271 PL-012 + Q-0272 reading-path tmpl),
  ALL CHECKS GREEN, deliberately parked `do-not-automerge` for owner ratification.
- QUEUED: ORDER 016 item 5 adopter-outcome writeup (~04:30–05:30Z slot) + its own
  06:00Z tally. Kit-lab loop cron fires 06:08Z. STALLED: none (01:49Z one-shot
  non-delivery bridged by the 02:07Z failsafe).

**Websites (ORDERs 035/041 + 042 new)**
- **ORDER 041 pickup: YES — effectively DONE.** Core SHIPPED as #236 (merged 02:46Z:
  /prompts/history/{seat} per-seat version ladder with view/diff/copy, version-aware
  drift row, 9-seat roster incl. curious-research, live-verified via /version at
  ff5b7c81) **and the remainder SHIPPED as #239** (merged 03:10Z: version ladder +
  drift on the dispatch screen /projects/{package} + the owner-console fleet
  prompt-state card — views over ONE source). Awaiting only the heartbeat done-flip.
- SHIPPED besides: 14 merges 02:40→04:45Z — /freshness fleet page #235 (+ #237/#240/
  #244 error-reason bounding chain), structural clarity gate across all four services
  #241, supersession warnings #243, readiness env-rollup JSON #246, **Puddle Museum
  page #247 + venture vetting catalog /products/catalog #248 (the ORDER 042 items,
  pre-built on seat initiative)**, contents-listing classifier #250. Suite 974+.
- OPEN-PRs: heartbeat fast-lane PR + in-flight dispatched slices (open per night
  rule 2). QUEUED: ORDER 042 verify-and-report (this PR). STALLED: none — the 00:45Z/
  01:39Z late ticks recovered by the 02:10Z failsafe fire.

**Game Lab — gba-homebrew / pokemon-mod-lab (ORDER 036; local ORDERs 005/007)**
- gba SHIPPED: breadth program ran all night — #75/#77–#81 merged pre-window; then
  **6 open parked PRs** (API-verified): #82 Brineward slices 6+7 (danger bands +
  reefs), #83 Deepcast (GBA fishing arcade, deterministic ROM 117,032 bytes), #84
  Drift Garden playable slice (PWA), #85 release packaging (web arcade bundle +
  versioned zips + RELEASE-HOWTO), #86 Cindervault (roguelike, breadth game #6), #87
  its own morning tally (04:48Z). All green-parked; self-landing blocked only by B#51
  (enabler refusal live-proven, run 29222310196).
- pokemon-mod-lab: **4 open parked PRs** — #57 root .gitignore ROM guard, #58 ORDER
  007 scribe, #59 review-queue #17 trace closure, #61 its own morning tally (04:46Z);
  #60 closed-retracted (the R27 false-positive rung-1 PR). Roster row still UNREADABLE
  (transport/auth) → B#49.
- QUEUED: owner sitting bundle items (concept pick, playtest verdicts). STALLED: none.

**Curious Research (ninth seat)**
- Existence/activity: repo NOT readable from this session (github MCP allowed-repo
  list excludes it — measurement wall, not lane death; same class as the roster's
  UNREADABLE rule). Registry-side the seat is REAL and live: v3.6 carries its founding
  pair, websites #236 verified its prompt package renders from the fm registry (29
  artifacts / 9 seats), and its **first failsafe fire proved out at 02:49Z** (29 min
  late inside the scheduler-degradation window, then healthy).

**superbot (hub)** — DARK by design overnight (roster gen #23); prod-bot lane landed
#2054/#2056 pre-window (00:04/00:27Z, lane-reported via superbot-next heartbeat).

### DROPPED-TICK REPORT

- Coordinator 00:06Z tick dropped (pruned same wake).
- **Scheduler degradation ~01:07–02:08Z:** SuperBot 2.0 + Ideas Lab failsafes each
  slipped one slot (wedged next_run_at frozen 01:07Z/01:38Z); 8 seats' one-shot ticks
  queued; flushed 02:30–02:50Z; **all lanes recovered by the 04:06Z trigger-registry
  export** (#157). No lane died; the R26 watchdog exports caught and recorded it.
- Curious Research first fire 02:49Z — 29 min late, PROVEN (first-fire evidence).
- substrate-kit 01:49Z pacemaker one-shot never delivered — failsafe bridged 02:07Z.

### ROUND-TRIP flag

- Ideas-loop round trip: idea-engine PROPOSAL 016 → sim-lab VERDICT 018 in **~25 min**
  — and the loop then repeated hands-free ALL NIGHT: 10 proposal→verdict cycles
  (P016–P025 → V017–V026), most recent P024 (merged 04:24Z) → V026 (04:50Z) = 26 min.
  The round trip is now routine, not a one-off.
- Fuller cross-seat loop found by the sweep: SBW publishes the minigame-section spec
  (mineverse #58) → superbot-next designs D-0082 (#329) → builds+merges slices 1–3
  (#334/#337/#341) — **a spec→design→build round trip across two seats completed
  within the night, zero owner input.** Also owner-goal→product: venture WEBSITE-IDEA
  markers (01:49Z) → websites pages live (#247/#248, ~04:2xZ) before the routing ORDER
  even landed.

### v3.6 state

Canonical in the registry (9 seats incl. Curious Research). Skim doc:
docs/prompts/v3/CHANGES-v3.4-to-v3.5.md. **Owner re-paste owed** — deployed seats
still run v3.4 pastes; the websites drift row (now version-aware, #236) shows
deployed-vs-canonical per seat.

### ORDER 041 state

Core + remainder SHIPPED (websites #236 + #239, live-verified at ff5b7c81); prompt
history is two clicks from the site root; every rendering traces to the registry.
Remaining: the done-flip in the websites heartbeat (their 06:00Z tally).

### R27 record

First execution ~02:36Z on pokemon-mod-lab = **verified FALSE POSITIVE** (parked-PR
heartbeat artifact + seat consolidation onto Game Lab). Rung-1 PR pml #60
closed-with-reason; lesson folded into R27 as the DETECTION amendment (#155).
Residue: pml stale branch `claude/fm-r27-wake-repair` awaits owner delete
(agent delete 403-walled).

### STALLED-with-error

- One fm remediation worker went silent (findings superseded by lane self-recovery —
  no impact). Nothing else fleet-wide; every seat that reported a stall recovered via
  failsafe within one slot.

### OWNER CLICKS (paste-ready pointers)

1. **B#49** — mint a read-only PAT → fm repo secret `ROSTER_READ_TOKEN`
   (docs/owner-queue.md B#49; unblocks honest pokemon-mod-lab roster rows).
2. **B#50** — superbot-idle: Settings → Allow auto-merge + require pytest/
   substrate-gate checks (idle #75/#76 have since merged; the click arms the enabler
   for future self-landing).
3. **B#51** — gba-homebrew: ruleset requiring `ROM builds` (unblocks self-landing of
   the 6 parked game PRs #82–#87; enabler refusal proof: run 29222310196).
4. **Sitting bundle E#28** (≤2026-07-13): Lumen Drift itch.io go/no-go · pokemon
   playtest verdicts · gba concept pick · post-EAP routine posture (recommended
   Option A one-liner in the bundle).
5. **Venture "go with defaults"** — one reply unblocks the 3 publish-READY products.
6. **superbot-next ruleset click** (OWNER-ACTION 3, PR #298 pointer) + owner flip of
   superbot #2058/#2061 mineverse drafts (review CodeQL on #2061 first).
7. **pml branch delete**: `claude/fm-r27-wake-repair` (403-walled for agents).
8. Morning sweep of the green-parked PRs: pml #57/#58/#59/#61 + gba #82–#87 (or B#51
   makes gba self-landing) + substrate-kit #317 ratification (label removal).

## 2026-07-13 · FLEET NIGHT-REPORT ROLL-UP (owner ask ~09:00Z)

Compiled 2026-07-13T09:56Z by the roll-up worker (fable-5), dispatched by the
coordinator (session_01UutkJqyMcHC1VyFW8fe1a9). Basis: the 13 seat NIGHT REPORTs
posted in response to the ~09:11Z NIGHT REPORT REQUEST orders, each read at its
landing ref; load-bearing merge SHAs spot-checked against the seats' live main
histories (1–2 per seat, all matched). Reporting window per seat: 2026-07-12T22:30Z
→ ~09:12–10:05Z. Lane-reported = the seat's own claim, not re-verified here.

### substrate-kit (ORDER 017 report, on main via PR #323 = `ba9a098`; also #320 tally)

- SHIPPED: 13 in-window merges #308–#316/#318–#322 (K0 gauge `174b113` · seed skills
  `2325e71` · adopter-outcome report `b171d02` · ORDER 016/017 landings, spot-checked).
- OPEN: #317 rider+reading-path graduation — ALL GREEN, `do-not-automerge` ratification
  park; landing path = owner review-merge. Only open PR.
- Orders 001–017 done/served. Asks: ⚑ set UNCHANGED (P10 required-check swap = B#10 ·
  fm #122 restamp · UNIVERSAL fetch-list bump · public-flip-or-PAT · grounded-skills
  window ~07-19..26) — all previously routed, nothing new to queue.
- Stalls: none; one platform anomaly — 01:49Z pacemaker one-shot never delivered,
  failsafe bridged 02:07Z (already on the fm status ⚑).
- Wake-chain: failsafe 6/6 fires; kit-lab daily cron delivered ON SCHEDULE 06:10Z —
  first proven fresh-session-per-fire scheduled delivery.
- NEXT: owner sweeps #317 → release wave (main 34+ commits past v1.15.0).

### curious-research (REPORT 001, on main `a7e9a3f` via PR #8)

- SHIPPED: 7 merges #1–#7 — kit seed + teaching doctrine (#1 `ff35b69`, verified),
  idea ritual (2 build / 1 think-more), 2 animated guides, possibility dossier.
- OPEN: none at report. Orders: 001 served. Stalls: one amend/force-push classifier
  denial (worked around); failsafe's FIRST fire 29 min late, on time since.
- Asks: slicer choice (unblocks retraction follow-up) — NOT previously queued →
  **added as queue item 55**. Gift-polish go/no-go: **OVERTAKEN BY EVENTS** — the trio
  shipped post-report at 09:55Z (#9 tolerance-test-coin · #10 welcome tour + README
  gift note); owner review is now retroactive veto on those merges, not a go/no-go.
- Discrepancy note: REPORT 001 is stamped 10:05Z but its PR #8 merged 09:20:58Z —
  stamp artifact, substance unaffected.

### gba-homebrew (ORDER 006 report — PARKED on PR #89 head `a84933b`)

- SHIPPED: 6 merges via the owner's 01:43–01:45Z hand-sweep — #75 Gloamline s10
  (merge `92d4f03`, verified; the seat itself corrected the circulating `253ff64` =
  head SHA) · #77/#78/#79/#80/#81 (Drift Garden PWA, Undertow, Tiltstone, rematch).
- OPEN: GREEN-PARKED SET #82–#89 (8 PRs — Brineward 6+7, Deepcast, Drift Garden
  game, release packaging + 4 zips, Cindervault, 2 control) — all check-runs success,
  run ids cited in the report; awaiting owner sweep or B#51.
- Stalls: enabler REFUSES TO ARM (no required-check contexts — verbatim located, run
  29222310196) = B#51 exactly; 3 coordinator-ledger denials could NOT be located
  verbatim in-repo (honest note); api.github.com REST silent-empty through the proxy.
- Asks: B#51 + sweep queued; NEW: stale-branch delete `claude/brineward-wind` after
  #82 → **folded into queue item 59**.
- Wake-chain: failsafe verified live (last 08:50Z, next 10:50Z); pacemaker at idle-anchor.
- Reading/merge note: #87 and #89 both create `control/outbox.md` — they conflict at
  sweep time; merge either first, the other re-lands trivially.

### pokemon-mod-lab (ORDER 008 report — PARKED on PR #63 head `db46649`)

- SHIPPED: **zero merges by design** — main stood at `759dee4` all night per the
  ORDER 007 owner park-green rule. Night work parked OPEN: #57 #58 #59 #61 #62 (+#63
  report PR), all both-checks green with run ids cited. #60 closed-retracted (R27
  false alarm, matches the fm record).
- Orders 001–008 served (006/007 pending-merge with the park). Repo visibility
  re-verified private 09:17Z (R22 guard).
- Asks: sweep clicks queued; carried OWNER-ACTIONs 1/2/3 queued (B#5/E#28); NEW:
  enabler-install decision (install kit auto-merge enabler vs keep park-and-sweep) →
  **added as queue item 58**; stale-ref deletes ×3 → **folded into queue item 59**.
- Stalls: only the pre-window self-merge classifier denial (known wall class).
- Wake-chain: failsafe verified live; pacemaker ticks all fired; idle-anchor.

### superbot-next (ORDER 018 report, on main; outbox 09:25Z)

- SHIPPED: **44 merges #306–#366** (every SHA verified by the seat against origin/main;
  #366 = `902791d` spot-checked) — fishing port complete, curation rework, D-0082
  slices, WP-1. CORRECTION vs the relayed ~35: actual 44; #302–#309 partly pre-window.
  superbot (per-ledger, seat has no repo access): 7 merges #2054–#2062; a circulating
  #2063 is UNVERIFIED from that seat — treat as not-merged unless seen repo-side.
- OPEN: 10 PRs — WP stack #312→#317→#335→#344 (green, owner sweep; non-claude/*
  branch so the enabler never arms) · #320 (green, classifier-denied merge — owner
  click) · #332 armed · #333/#345 ZERO check-runs (outage residue — need a CI
  re-trigger) · #352 pending · #354 the only genuine red (check_compat_frozen).
  superbot #2058/#2061 = deliberate DRAFT deploy-holds (owner flip = deploy).
- Stalls (8 verbatim denials in the report): merge-without-review ×2, CI-bypass on the
  enabler-workflow bundle, force-push/reset/dropdb worker denials, scratch-branch 403,
  hermes `missing_config`. Platform: trigger-scheduler wedge 01:07–02:44Z (recovered) ·
  Actions check-run outage ~03:40Z (residue = #333/#345).
- Asks: OWNER-ACTION 3/5 + ORDER 001 token run queued; NEW: curation DROP-list (60
  items) + settings-prune + D-0083 anchor ratifications → **queue item 57**; hermes
  egress creds (CLAUDE_ROUTINE_FIRE_URL + token) → **queue item 60**. SBW minigame
  inventory+spec SIM-REQUEST is seat-to-seat (manager relay, not owner).
- Wake-chain: failsafe + pacemaker healthy end-to-end incl. late-flushed wedge ticks.

### superbot-games (ORDER 006 report, on main 09:22Z)

- SHIPPED: 14 merges #65–#78 (enabler install `dd867c8` + dnd finalize `0ee7482`
  spot-checked) — mining/fishing WORKFLOW seams, standalone CLIs, hub launcher, dnd +
  exploration finalized. Suite 310 → **516**, floors met, verified at HEAD.
- OPEN: none (API-verified). Orders all served incl. fm ORDER 037 (#76). Stalls: none.
- Asks: 4 SIM-REQUESTs already routed (fm ORDER 044 → idea-engine local ORDER 006);
  D2 audit-item-grants ratification + standalone-CLI persistence format governance +
  rung-3 packaging decision remain seat-queued (decide-and-flag reversible; flagged
  here, NOT added to the owner queue — manager can bundle them into the next sitting
  if the owner wants them owner-side).
- Wake-chain (seat-level, one chain for games/idle/mineverse): failsafe verified live
  09:16Z; pacemaker continuous; one duplicate tick ~02:35Z pruned same-wake.

### superbot-idle (ORDER 004 report, on main 09:25Z)

- SHIPPED: 9 merges #75–#83 — enabler install, PLUG-001 adapter inc1+inc2 (the
  cross-seat plugin contract now consumed), catalog wave 4 (15 packs), playability
  wave. Suite → **1260 passed**, verified at HEAD `161bc7d`.
- OPEN: none. Orders 001–004 done. Stalls: none in-repo.
- Asks: ALL previously routed — SIM-001 economy-FEEL cluster (ORDER 043/005 relay),
  the 2 owner Q-blocks = queue items 52/53 (assigned yesterday-night), OA-003 pytest
  required check = B#50. Nothing new to queue.
- Wake-chain: seat-level chain healthy (see superbot-games line).

### superbot-mineverse (ORDER 005 report, on main 09:28Z)

- SHIPPED: 17 merges #50–#66 (ORDER 005 landing `3fe538e` + minigame spec `7f33c2b`
  spot-checked) — minigame section spec for SuperBot 2.0, FLAG-1/FLAG-2 seams,
  conformance runner, dedupes. Suite → **522 passed** at HEAD.
- Cross-seat (lane-reported): fishing port complete in superbot-next; WP stack +
  #320 open there (matches that seat's own report).
- OPEN in-repo: none. Orders 001–005 done. Stalls: none.
- Asks: MINING_WRITE_ENDPOINT + SECRET pair already queued (C-group); substrate-kit
  born-red fail-open gate fix is seat→kit (idea already filed kit-side, not owner);
  dig-gating A/B/C rides superbot-next #320's body (part of the WP-stack sweep —
  flagged, not separately queued).
- Wake-chain: seat-level chain healthy.

### idea-engine + sim-lab (Ideas Lab seat — NIGHT-REPORT 001 twins, on both mains 09:31/09:32Z)

- SHIPPED: idea-engine **31 merges #276–#306** (21 PROPOSALs P014–P034 + 10 control;
  P034 `eea4e5b` spot-checked) · sim-lab **26 merges #57–#82** (21 VERDICTs V015–V035:
  7 approve / 1 conditional / 7 null / 6 reject; V035 `24ba4f7` spot-checked). The
  proposal→verdict loop ran hands-free all night.
- OPEN: only the two night-report PRs at final append (since landed — reports read on
  main). Orders: 003 standing-ACTIVE · 004/007 done · 005/006 acked — the 9
  SIM-REQUESTs are being dispatched to sim sessions THIS WAKE; intake consumed
  through V035, next = INTAKE 034 → V036.
- Asks: ASK 001 (upstream claude/ prefix into the kit enabler template) is seat→kit,
  already relayed. sim-lab NOTE: ROUTINE_PAT not set — GITHUB_TOKEN fallback works;
  flag only if PAT attribution is wanted (noted, not queued).
- Stalls: Write-tool report-file refusals ×5+ (workers switched to text, zero loss) ·
  sleep block · one gh 502 · #271 enabler-allowlist jam (fixed #272). A watchdog
  "wedge" claim was checked and REFUTED against the trigger registry.
- Wake-chain: failsafe healthy (last 07:39Z); pacemaker unbroken all night.

### venture-lab (ORDER 009 report, on main 09:26Z)

- SHIPPED: **46 merges #96–#141** (first-parent verified by the seat; #141 `374e8d1` +
  tally `5814880` spot-checked) — 6 products publish-READY at the quality floor +
  SWTK $29 verified live; ~215k words (6 books + 2 novella cuts + Ultramarine serial +
  4 NL editions) + 27 board-book texts; OWNER-QUEUE 106 clicks / 18 sequences.
- OPEN: zero. Orders 001–009 served/terminal. Stalls: none material; the dawn
  forced-update marker investigated CLEAN (fast-forward artifact, twice re-verified).
- Asks: 5 SIM-REQUESTs all routed (ORDERs 043/044 + B#54 sandbox) · "go with
  defaults" one-reply unblock queued · seat OWNER-QUEUE 17 decision rows (D1–D4
  headline, NL titles, board-book channel, Weigh House strategy, Painted Stones D9
  rec: Park) live in venture's own docs/publishing/OWNER-QUEUE.md — pointer stands,
  not duplicated here. 10 WEBSITE-IDEAs: routed/self-triaged (ORDER 042 satisfied).
- Wake-chain: failsafe on schedule all night; pacemaker resumed at ORDER service;
  grading cron next 07-17; SWTK T+7/T+14 checks armed 07-19/07-26.

### trading-strategy (ORDER-013 report, on main 09:22Z)

- SHIPPED: 18 merges #80–#97 (synthesis `374651a` + tally `de5a477` spot-checked) —
  Round-3 research complete: **3,468 configs / 312 graded lanes → 0 PROMOTED / 64
  KEEP-dev / 248 KILL, max t 1.38 vs bar 2.64 — honest null, rails held** (holdout +
  paper byte-untouched, verified via diff). Notable negative: TSLA rsi mean-reversion
  t = −3.01. Ledger +309 rows; 437 tests green on main CI.
- OPEN: zero. Orders 001–013 done/served. Stalls: none material.
- Asks: NEW — KILL-SIG three-way verdict-class proposal (KEEP/KILL/KILL-SIG from the
  already-computed t-stat) awaiting review → **added as queue item 56**. Next research
  round awaits direction (manager-side). Holdout re-arm stays owner-gated (E#31 class).
- Wake-chain: failsafe on schedule; grading cron 07-17 (rebind, never delete).

### websites (ORDER 023 report, on main 09:30Z)

- SHIPPED: **45 merges #217–#264** (clarity gate `1b294d5` + bake `bcf2943`
  spot-checked) — clarity bar CI-PERMANENT (123 routes) · prompt library complete
  (drift row, version history, supersession) · batch-2 venture markers 5 built / 1
  dup / 1 remaining / 1 owner-gated · **first-ever successful scheduled review bake**
  (run 29235587736, SUCCESS 08:28:54Z) with its data PR #259 landed after a
  close/reopen kick. Suite 757 → **1172 passed**.
- OPEN: 3 draft kit-stub lifeboats #245/#249/#257 (do-not-merge by design; owner may
  close + delete branches). Zero open non-draft.
- Stalls (verbatim in report): `rm` classifier denial ("[Irreversible Local
  Destruction]") → lifeboat workaround · scheduler late-delivery 00:45–02:10Z
  (recovered) · **GITHUB_TOKEN-authored PRs can't self-trigger CI** (anti-recursion) —
  the #259 finding; kit/fleet note: bot-opened PRs need a PAT-authored open or a
  reopen kick. Worth folding into the kit's enabler doctrine.
- Asks: SEVEN owner asks, all canonical in websites `docs/owner/OWNER-ACTIONS.md`
  (Q-0004 topology gate · Discord OAuth · control-API token · SITE_PASSWORD ·
  DATABASE_URL · PayPal creds · contents:write PAT) — pointer previously recorded in
  the fm queue's parked section; not re-duplicated.
- Wake-chain: failsafe verified (last 08:45Z, next 10:45Z); pacemaker live; the
  6-pending-one-shots observation = multiple concurrent seats' ticks, self-retiring.
- ORDER 024 in flight: /prompts current-generation-source fix is the next slice.

### FLEET FOOTER

- **Totals:** summing the reports' own in-window merge counts: **≈276 PRs merged
  fleet-wide overnight** across the 13 reporting repos (kit 13 · cr 7 · gba 6 ·
  pml 0-by-design · next 44 · games 14 · idle 9 · mineverse 17 · idea-engine 31 ·
  sim-lab 26 · venture 46 · trading 18 · websites 45) **+ 7 superbot merges
  per-ledger** (unverifiable from the reporting seat). As-reported sum — windows
  vary by ~40 min at the edges and some counts include manager-authored order
  landings; not independently re-counted repo-by-repo.
- **Coverage: 13/13 posted, 0 pending.** Report stamps 09:22Z–10:05Z (the 10:05Z
  curious-research stamp is a clock artifact — its PR merged 09:20:58Z).
- **NEW asks surfaced by the roll-up, now queued** (docs/owner-queue.md, this PR):
  **55** curious-research slicer answer (E) · **56** trading KILL-SIG verdict class
  (E) · **57** superbot-next curation ratifications — DROP-list 60 items +
  settings-prune + D-0083 anchor (E) · **58** pml enabler-install decision (E) ·
  **59** stale-branch delete batch gba×1 + pml×3 (B) · **60** superbot-next hermes
  egress creds (C). Flagged-not-queued (seat-side or decide-and-flag): games
  D2/persistence/rung-3 ratifications · mineverse dig-gating (rides next #320) ·
  sim-lab ROUTINE_PAT attribution · venture's 17 seat-queue decision rows (pointer
  stands). OVERTAKEN: curious-research gift-polish go/no-go (trio shipped 09:55Z,
  #9/#10 — owner review is now retroactive).
- **Stall classes worth owner eyes:** the GITHUB_TOKEN-PR-can't-self-trigger-CI
  finding (websites #259 — kit doctrine candidate) · trigger-scheduler wedge
  01:07–02:44Z + the undelivered kit pacemaker one-shot (platform, both bridged by
  failsafes) · the superbot-next #333/#345 zero-check-run residue (needs a CI
  re-trigger before any sweep).
- **Parked-PR reading note:** the gba and pml night reports live on PR heads
  (gba #89 `a84933b`, pml #63 `db46649`), NOT on their mains, until the owner sweep
  lands the parked sets; gba #87 vs #89 conflict on `control/outbox.md` creation —
  merge either first, the other re-lands trivially.
- **Wake-chain fleet health: 13/13 chains alive.** Every seat's failsafe verified
  (most API-verified at write); the night's two platform incidents (scheduler wedge,
  dropped one-shots) were bridged by failsafes with zero lost work.

## 2026-07-13 · Q-0264 FAN-IN — ALL 9 SIM-REQUEST VERDICTS SERVED (relay record, wake work session ~13:15Z)

Successor-baton item 1 verified and served: Ideas Lab consumed both relayed batches
(idea-engine local ORDERs 005/006 = fm ORDER 043's two + fm ORDER 044's seven) and
sim-lab finalized ALL NINE verdicts — INTAKE simreq-001…009 → VERDICTs 036-adjacent
037–045, every one `status: finalized` at sim-lab HEAD `afe18f3` (timestamps
09:43–11:35Z; idea-engine HEAD `c807960` NIGHT-REPORT 001 corroborates the dispatch).
Each verdict names its requesting seat for manager relay (Q-0264 — verdicts route only
through the manager). **Relay pointers by seat** (this session is repo-scoped to
fleet-manager; the coordinator relays these into the seat inboxes at next dispatch,
or the seats read them here at next wake):

- **venture-lab** (4): V037 Ultramarine serial pricing — CONDITIONAL (R3 default: no
  carry-through data; default arm per packet) · V039 photo packs — CONDITIONAL ($5
  fixed default + bundle row; packs stay owner-gated on originals) · V040 Ship-It
  Bundle — CONDITIONAL ($59 ratified w/ parked switch rule) · V041 narrow-TAM
  cookbooks — CONDITIONAL ($19 fixed default; no PWYW data exists).
- **superbot-idle** (1): V038 SIM-001 economy-FEEL — CONDITIONAL (graduate the
  seven-parameter PROVISIONAL table; strict-A10 fails but inside 0.02 wiggle band;
  A10 re-wording lands in docs/design/economy-v1.md, seat-side). Co-consumer:
  owner-queue E#52 (generator purchase curve).
- **superbot-games** (4): V042 mining-economy — APPROVE (ratify every packet constant;
  2 flagged rows: pickaxe feltness + booster pricing — booster-bypass follow-up
  already in flight as idea-engine PROPOSAL 035, 12:12Z) · V043 fishing-economy —
  APPROVE-WITH-CONSTANTS (both asks: sell curve + progression; wire VERBATIM at the
  seam) · V044 dnd-escort-double-mint — MINT-AT-MOST-ONCE (uncapped faucet, guard at
  bundle fold) · V045 exploration-reward-bands — RATIFY-WITH-NULL (placeholders stay
  verbatim; numeric band import waits on the named upstream superbot P0 artifact).

Also received this wake (route to Self Improvement seat at next dispatch):
**idea-engine ASK 002** (2026-07-13T12:45:33Z, target fleet-manager, status new) —
make kit-repo-local `bootstrap.py check --strict` run the SAME preflight legs as the
CI substrate-gate (check_ideas --outbox + inbox append-only grammar w/ merge-base) so
local green ⇒ CI green; evidence: two local-green→CI-red round-trips in one night
(idea-engine PRs #274, #299). Kit-owned; agent-doable; no owner click.

## 2026-07-13 · PARKED-SET CURRENCY DELTA (wake work session, verified live ~13:20Z)

Updates to the FLEET NIGHT-REPORT ROLL-UP owner-sweep list, every state read from
live GitHub this wake:

- **gba-homebrew: the parked set is now #82–#90** (was #82–#89) — new seat-ender
  PR #90 opened 10:57:01Z (`claude/seat-ender-20260713` @ `7ba68fb`); #82–#89 all
  still OPEN, READY. Enabler still refuses to arm (zero required contexts;
  refusal re-verified in PR #89's report, run 29222310196) — B#51
  (OQ-GBA-ROM-RULESET) unchanged, still the unblock.
- **pokemon-mod-lab: the parked set is now #57–#59 + #61–#64** — new seat-ender
  PR #64 opened 10:55:20Z (@ `c2da09e`); #60 remains closed-retracted. B#58
  (OQ-PML-ENABLER-INSTALL) unchanged.
- **substrate-kit #317: still OPEN, now carries `do-not-automerge`** (program-law
  gate designed hold; head `82fca96`). New: heartbeat PR #326 opened 12:51:53Z by
  the REBOOTED Self Improvement seat (v3.6 boot) — the reboot wave is live.
- **superbot-idle: parked set CLEARED** — #75 + #76 self-landed 01:23–01:26Z
  (merged_by github-actions[bot]); open idle PRs = 0. Owner-queue B#50 marked
  ✅ RESOLVED this wake with the merge evidence.

## 2026-07-13 · Q-0264 RELAY-CONSUMPTION SWEEP — ALL FAN-OUT STILL OWED (trigger-health worker session, verified read-only 13:13:45Z)

Verification pass on the FAN-IN relay record above (L468–502): all four
lane-inbox writes are **still owed** — venture-lab ← V037/V039/V040/V041 ·
superbot-idle ← V038 (clears that lane's declared RESUME TRIGGER,
status.md L8/L94) · superbot-games ← V042/V043/V044/V045 · substrate-kit
(Self Improvement seat) ← idea-engine ASK 002. Consumption verified PENDING
at every target's live HEAD: venture-lab `765e1f8` · superbot-idle `b03cc96`
· superbot-games `57f69be` · substrate-kit `949875c` (originator idea-engine
`c807960` still shows ASK 002 `status: new`). No verdict string appears in
any target lane's control files; no lane self-served from this outbox. Full
SHA-cited per-verdict table: `docs/fleet-triage.md` § "2026-07-13 · Q-0264
relay-consumption sweep". Fan-out remains with the coordinator at next
dispatch, per the relay record's own wording.

## 2026-07-13 · Q-0264 FAN-OUT COMPLETE — relays delivered lane-side (coordinator dispatch, 2026-07-13T13:47:30Z)

All four owed relays from the FAN-IN record (L468–502) and the relay-consumption
sweep above are now DELIVERED and MERGED lane-side:

- **venture-lab PR #161** — ORDER 010 (V037/V039/V040/V041) — MERGED 13:42:35Z,
  8/8 checks green, tip `a3e95fc`.
- **superbot-idle PR #88** — ORDER 005 (V038) — MERGED 13:43:00Z, 4/4 checks
  green, tip `5a4ac35`; that lane's declared RESUME TRIGGER
  (control/status.md:94 @ `3a4fa5f`) is cleared for its SIM-001/V038 component.
- **superbot-games PR #80** — ORDER 007 (V042–V045) — MERGED 13:44:13Z, 3/3
  checks green, tip `af36d52`.
- **substrate-kit PR #329** — ORDER 018 (idea-engine ASK 002 → Self Improvement
  seat) — MERGED 13:43:11Z, 4/4 checks green, tip `9a6caa4`.

All four merged by each repo's own enable-auto-merge automation
(github-actions[bot]) on green; no denials; entries append-only,
control/inbox.md-only diffs; sources verified at sim-lab `afe18f3` ·
fm `a32eb2c` · idea-engine `c807960`. Relayed by the Fleet Manager seat per
Q-0264, coordinator dispatch 2026-07-13.

**Upkeep (stale claim cleanup):** deleted
`control/claims/claude-trigger-health-i1-fix.md` — its lane's PR #167 is
terminal (MERGED 2026-07-13T13:36:04Z by github-actions[bot], squash
`d5b5b4e`); the claim file itself accidentally landed on main via that same
merge. Claims are delete-at-close.

## 2026-07-13 · I1b DISPOSITION — "superbot autonomous dispatch" trigger is a dormant owner-paused remnant (failsafe-wake 20:33Z executor session, 2026-07-13T20:52Z)

Finding for fan-out to the **superbot hub seat** (the trigger's owner — it is NOT
fleet-manager's; nothing was modified). Classifies the standing I1b
AMBIGUOUS-ENABLED WARN row in `scripts/check_trigger_health.py`.

**Verdict:** `trig_011XAWqPeksS8LBrS5G9RvVc` "superbot autonomous dispatch"
(cron `0 */3 * * *`) is a **dormant, owner-paused remnant of the pre-fleet-era
dispatch routine** — not a wedge, not a platform auto-disable, and not a live
routine to rebind. **Recommended disposition (by the superbot seat, owner
confirming since the pause was an owner action): delete it in the console, or
annotate-and-leave-paused; do NOT re-enable or rebind as-is.** Its stored
prompt carries retired doctrine (the Q-0117 `needs-hermes-review` gate, retired
by Q-0197; pre-Q-0265 seat model) — a future scheduled hub wake should be a
FRESH trigger from current prompt sources. The sibling record
`trig_01MWHvQFnRF1dVdZFSP6SM5L` "superbot night executor" (documented as MERGED
into dispatch, Q-0145) is the same remnant class — dispose together.

**Evidence (SHA-cited):** registry — fresh export
`telemetry/triggers-snapshot.json` `captured_at 2026-07-13T20:42:00Z` (fm PR
#175, commit `90e1a7f`): `enabled` ABSENT + `ended_reason` ABSENT (= user-paused
per the CCR `list_triggers` contract), `last_fired_at` 2026-07-02T00:07:46Z,
`updated_at` 2026-07-02T02:38:10Z, `next_run_at` frozen 2026-07-02T03:07:12Z;
superbot's env (`env_01CZRF681i8ef2zqt9GgboYy`) has exactly one ENABLED trigger
left (the poke-only `suberbot docs reconciliation`). Repo — superbot
`docs/operations/autonomous-routines.md` @ main `1cc5536` L30 (identity + Q-0146
console-Schedule cadence + Q-0197 retirement), L279–289 (night-executor merge,
Q-0145), L331 (console pause/kill path). Full SHA-cited note:
`docs/fleet-triage.md` § "2026-07-13 · I1b disposition".

**Rider for the superbot seat:** doc drift — `autonomous-routines.md@1cc5536`
L395/L406 still present the dispatch console Schedule as the live cadence;
annotate when disposing.
